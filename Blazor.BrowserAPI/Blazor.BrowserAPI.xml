            If set to a value less than zero the device must return a cached position regardless of its age.
            Default: 0.

            <param name="timeout">
            A positive long value representing the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) the device is allowed to take in order to return a position.

            <param name="enableHighAccuracy">
            A boolean value that indicates the application would like to receive the best possible results.
            If true and if the device is able to provide a more accurate position, it will do so.
            Note that this can result in slower response times or increased power consumption (with a GPS chip on a mobile device for example).
            On the other hand, if false, the device can take the liberty to save resources by responding more quickly and/or using less power.
            Default: false.

            The <i>Element.getBoundingClientRect()</i> method returns a DOMRect object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.

            <returns>
            <para>
            The returned value is a DOMRect object which is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, including its padding and border-width.
            The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels.
            Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.
            </para>
            <para>
            The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height.
            In the standard box model, this would be equal to the width or height property of the element + padding + border-width.
            But if box-sizing: border-box is set for the element this would be directly equal to its width or height.
            </para>
            <para>The returned value can be thought of as the union of the rectangles returned by getClientRects() for the element, i.e., the CSS border-boxes associated with the element.</para>
            <para>
            Empty border-boxes are completely ignored.
            If all the element's border-boxes are empty, then a rectangle is returned with a width and height of zero
            and where the top and left are the top-left of the border-box for the first CSS box (in content order) for the element.
            </para>
            <para>
            The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area (or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the bounding rectangle.
            This means that the rectangle's boundary edges (top, right, bottom, left) change their values every time the scrolling position changes (because their values are relative to the viewport and not absolute).
            </para>
            <para>
            If you need the bounding rectangle relative to the top-left corner of the document, just add the current scrolling position to the top and left properties
            (these can be obtained using window.scrollY and window.scrollX) to get a bounding rectangle which is independent from the current scrolling position.

            For tables with captions, the caption is included even though it's outside the border box of the table.
            When called on SVG elements other than an outer-&lt;svg&gt;, the "viewport" that the resulting rectangles are relative to is the viewport that the element's outer-&lt;svg&gt; establishes

            <para>
            The <i>setPointerCapture()</i> method of the Element interface is used to designate a specific element as the capture target of future pointer events.
            Subsequent events for the pointer will be targeted at the capture element until capture is released (via Element.releasePointerCapture() or the pointerup event is fired).
            </para>
            <para>
            Note: Pointer capture will cause the target to capture all subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing target.
            Accordingly, pointerover, pointerenter, pointerleave, and pointerout will not fire as long as this capture is set.
            For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers.
            The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.
            </para>
            <para>
            Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location.
            This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).

            The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height.

            For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers.
            The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.
            </para>
            <para>
            Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location.
            This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).

            User agents are encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the event each time,
            so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.

            The NetworkInformation interface of the Network Information API provides information about the connection a device is using to communicate with the network and provides a means for scripts to be notified if the connection type changes.
            The NetworkInformation interface cannot be instantiated. It is instead accessed through the connection property of the Navigator interface or the WorkerNavigator interface.

            <para>
            The onLine property of the Navigator interface returns whether the device is connected to the network, with true meaning online and false meaning offline.
            The property's value changes after the browser checks its network connection, usually when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page.
            For example, the property should return false when users click links soon after they lose internet connection.
            When its value changes, an online or offline event is fired on the window.
            </para>
            <para>
            Browsers and operating systems leverage different heuristics to determine whether the device is online.
            In general, connection to LAN is considered online, even though the LAN may not have Internet access.
            For example, the computer may be running a virtualization software that has virtual ethernet adapters that are always "connected".
            On Windows, the online status is determined by whether it can reach a Microsoft home server, which may be blocked by firewalls or VPNs, even if the computer has Internet access.
            Therefore, this property is inherently unreliable, and you should not disable features based on the online status, only provide hints when the user may seem offline.

            - "natural": The natural orientation of the screen from the underlying operating system: either "portrait-primary" or "landscape-primary".<br />

If the natural orientation is a landscape mode (screen width is greater than height), this will be the same as the natural orientation, and correspond to an angle of 0 degrees.

            <para>
            The <i>MediaTrackSupportedConstraints</i> dictionary establishes the list of constrainable properties recognized by the user agent or browser in its implementation of the MediaStreamTrack object.
            An object conforming to MediaTrackSupportedConstraints is returned by <see cref="M:BrowserAPI.IMediaDevices.GetSupportedConstraints(System.Threading.CancellationToken)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Because of the way interface definitions in WebIDL work, if a constraint is requested but not supported, no error will occur.
            Instead, the specified constraints will be applied, with any unrecognized constraints stripped from the request.
            That can lead to confusing and hard to debug errors, so be sure to use getSupportedConstraints() to retrieve this information before attempting to establish constraints
            if you need to know the difference between silently ignoring a constraint and a constraint being accepted.

            <summary>
            The <i>Element.getBoundingClientRect()</i> method returns a DOMRect object providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport.
            </summary>
            <param name="cancellationToken"></param>
            <returns>
            <para>
            The returned value is a DOMRect object which is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, including its padding and border-width.
            The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels.
            Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.
            </para>
            <para>
            The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height.
            In the standard box model, this would be equal to the width or height property of the element + padding + border-width.
            But if box-sizing: border-box is set for the element this would be directly equal to its width or height.
            </para>
            <para>The returned value can be thought of as the union of the rectangles returned by getClientRects() for the element, i.e., the CSS border-boxes associated with the element.</para>
            <para>
            Empty border-boxes are completely ignored.
            If all the element's border-boxes are empty, then a rectangle is returned with a width and height of zero
            and where the top and left are the top-left of the border-box for the first CSS box (in content order) for the element.
            </para>
            <para>
            The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area (or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the bounding rectangle.
            This means that the rectangle's boundary edges (top, right, bottom, left) change their values every time the scrolling position changes (because their values are relative to the viewport and not absolute).
            </para>
            <para>
            If you need the bounding rectangle relative to the top-left corner of the document, just add the current scrolling position to the top and left properties
            (these can be obtained using window.scrollY and window.scrollX) to get a bounding rectangle which is independent from the current scrolling position.

            <para>The <i>getClientRects()</i> method of the Element interface returns a collection of DOMRect objects that indicate the bounding rectangles for each CSS border box in a client.</para>

            <returns>
            <para>
            The returned value is a collection of DOMRect objects, one for each CSS border box associated with the element.
            Each DOMRect object describes the border box, in pixels, with the top-left relative to the top-left of the viewport.
            For tables with captions, the caption is included even though it's outside the border box of the table.
            When called on SVG elements other than an outer-&lt;svg&gt;, the "viewport" that the resulting rectangles are relative to is the viewport that the element's outer-&lt;svg&gt; establishes
            (and to be clear, the rectangles are also transformed by the outer-&lt;svg&gt;'s viewBox transform, if any).

            <summary>
            <para>
            The <i>setPointerCapture()</i> method of the Element interface is used to designate a specific element as the capture target of future pointer events.
            Subsequent events for the pointer will be targeted at the capture element until capture is released (via Element.releasePointerCapture() or the pointerup event is fired).
            </para>
            <para>
            Note: Pointer capture will cause the target to capture all subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing target.
            Accordingly, pointerover, pointerenter, pointerleave, and pointerout will not fire as long as this capture is set.
            For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers.
            The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.
            </para>
            <para>
            Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location.
            This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).

            The <i>animationstart</i> event is fired when a CSS Animation has started.
            If there is an animation-delay, this event will fire once the delay period has expired.
            A negative delay will cause the event to fire with an elapsedTime equal to the absolute value of the delay (and, correspondingly, the animation will begin playing at that time index into the sequence).

            Note: innerText is easily confused with Node.textContent, but there are important differences between the two.

            It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after. For the document body object, the measurement includes total linear content height instead of the element's CSS height.Floated elements extending below other linear content are ignored.

            However, for inline-level elements (such as span) that can wrap from one line to the next, offsetTop and offsetLeft describe the positions of the first border box
            (use Element.getClientRects() to get its width and height), while offsetWidth and offsetHeight describe the dimensions of the bounding border box(use Element.getBoundingClientRect() to get its position).
            Therefore, a box with the left, top, width and height of offsetLeft, offsetTop, offsetWidth and offsetHeight will not be a bounding box for a span with wrapped text.

            The returned value is a DOMRect object which is the smallest rectangle which contains the entire element, including its padding and border-width.
            The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels.
            Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.
            </para>
            <para>
            The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height.
            In the standard box model, this would be equal to the width or height property of the element + padding + border-width.
            But if box-sizing: border-box is set for the element this would be directly equal to its width or height.

            The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area (or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the bounding rectangle.

            Accordingly, pointerover, pointerenter, pointerleave, and pointerout will not fire as long as this capture is set.
            For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers.
            The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.
            </para>
            <para>
            Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location.
            This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).

            <para>
            The onLine property of the Navigator interface returns whether the device is connected to the network, with true meaning online and false meaning offline.
            The property's value changes after the browser checks its network connection, usually when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page.
            For example, the property should return false when users click links soon after they lose internet connection.
            When its value changes, an online or offline event is fired on the window.
            </para>
            <para>
            Browsers and operating systems leverage different heuristics to determine whether the device is online.
            In general, connection to LAN is considered online, even though the LAN may not have Internet access.
            For example, the computer may be running a virtualization software that has virtual ethernet adapters that are always "connected".
            On Windows, the online status is determined by whether it can reach a Microsoft home server, which may be blocked by firewalls or VPNs, even if the computer has Internet access.
            Therefore, this property is inherently unreliable, and you should not disable features based on the online status, only provide hints when the user may seem offline.

            - "natural": The natural orientation of the screen from the underlying operating system: either "portrait-primary" or "landscape-primary".<br />

If the natural orientation is a portrait mode, this will have an angle of 180 degrees (in other words, the device is upside down relative to its natural orientation).
