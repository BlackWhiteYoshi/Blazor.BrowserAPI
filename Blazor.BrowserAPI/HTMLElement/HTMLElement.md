# HTMLElement

The *HTMLElement* interface represents any HTML element.
Some elements directly implement this interface, while others implement it via an interface that inherits it.

## Example

```razor
<div @ref="divElement">
    <p>Content of div</p>
</div>

<p>Width: @divWidth</p>
<p>Height: @divHeight</p>
```

```csharp
public sealed partial class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase, IAsyncDisposable {
    [Inject]
    public required IHTMLElementFactory HTMLElementFactory { private get; init; }

    private ElementReference divElement;
    private IHTMLElement? div;

    private int divWidth;
    private int divHeight;

    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender) {
        if (firstRender) {
            div = HTMLElementFactory.Create(divElement);
            divWidth = await div.ClientWidth;
            divHeight = await div.ClientHeight;
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }

    public ValueTask DisposeAsync() => div?.DisposeAsync() ?? ValueTask.CompletedTask;
}
```

## Members

### IHTMLElementFactory

This class can take a *ElementReference* and creates a *IHTMLElement* or *IHTMLElementProcess* object with it.

This factory **does not dispose** the created onjects, they must disposed manually.
So do not forget to call Dispose()/DisposeAsync() on a htmlElement-object when you are done with it.

### IHTMLElement

The *HTMLElement* interface represents any HTML element. Some elements directly implement this interface, while others implement it via an interface that inherits it.

Objects of this class must disposed manually, so do not forget to call DisposeAsync() when you are done with it.

#### Properties

| **Name**          | **Type**                                          | get/set | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| InnerText         | ValueTask&lt;string&gt;                           | get     | The *innerText* property of the HTMLElement interface represents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants.<br></br>As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard. As a setter this will replace the element's children with the given value, converting any line breaks into &lt;br&gt; elements.<br></br>Note: innerText is easily confused with Node.textContent, but there are important differences between the two. Basically, innerText is aware of the rendered appearance of text, while textContent is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| ScrollTop         | ValueTask&lt;int&gt;                              | get     | The *Element.scrollTop* property gets or sets the number of pixels that an element's content is scrolled vertically.<br></br>An element's scrollTop value is a measurement of the distance from the element's top to its topmost visible content. When an element's content does not generate a vertical scrollbar, then its scrollTop value is 0.<br></br>scrollTop can be set to any integer value, with certain caveats:<br></br>- If the element can't be scrolled (e.g. it has no overflow or if the element has a property of "non-scrollable"), scrollTop is 0.<br></br>- scrollTop doesn't respond to negative values; instead, it sets itself back to 0.<br></br>- If set to a value greater than the maximum available for the element, scrollTop settles itself to the maximum value.<br></br>When scrollTop is used on the root element (the &lt;html&gt; element), the scrollY of the window is returned. [This is a special case of scrollTop](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-cssom-view-1-20160317/#dom-element-scrolltop).<br></br>Warning: On systems using display scaling, scrollTop may give you a decimal value.

If you need a fractional value, use element.getBoundingClientRect().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

For example, if the computed "border-top-width" is zero, then clientTop is also zero.<br></br>Note: This property will round the value to an integer.If you need a fractional value, use element.getBoundingClientRect().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels. Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.<br></br>The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height. In the standard box model, this would be equal to the width or height property of the element + padding + border-width. But if box-sizing: border-box is set for the element this would be directly equal to its width or height.<br></br>The returned value can be thought of as the union of the rectangles returned by getClientRects() for the element, i.e., the CSS border-boxes associated with the element.<br></br>Empty border-boxes are completely ignored. If all the element's border-boxes are empty, then a rectangle is returned with a width and height of zero and where the top and left are the top-left of the border-box for the first CSS box (in content order) for the element.<br></br>The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area (or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the bounding rectangle. This means that the rectangle's boundary edges (top, right, bottom, left) change their values every time the scrolling position changes (because their values are relative to the viewport and not absolute).<br></br>If you need the bounding rectangle relative to the top-left corner of the document, just add the current scrolling position to the top and left properties (these can be obtained using window.scrollY and window.scrollX) to get a bounding rectangle which is independent from the current scrolling position. |

Each DOMRect object describes the border box, in pixels, with the top-left relative to the top-left of the viewport. For tables with captions, the caption is included even though it's outside the border box of the table. When called on SVG elements other than an outer-&lt;svg&gt;, the "viewport" that the resulting rectangles are relative to is the viewport that the element's outer-&lt;svg&gt; establishes (and to be clear, the rectangles are also transformed by the outer-&lt;svg&gt;'s viewBox transform, if any).<br></br>The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area(or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the rectangles.<br></br>The returned rectangles do not include the bounds of any child elements that might happen to overflow.<br></br>For HTML&lt;area&gt; elements, SVG elements that do not render anything themselves, display:none elements, and generally any elements that are not directly rendered, an empty list is returned.<br></br>Rectangles are returned even for CSS boxes that have empty border-boxes.The left, top, right, and bottom coordinates can still be meaningful.<br></br>Fractional pixel offsets are possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Subsequent events for the pointer will be targeted at the capture element until capture is released (via Element.releasePointerCapture() or the pointerup event is fired).<br></br>Note: Pointer capture will cause the target to capture all subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing target. Accordingly, pointerover, pointerenter, pointerleave, and pointerout will not fire as long as this capture is set. For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers. The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.<br></br>Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location. This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| OnTransitionstart    | Action<string, double, string> | The *transitionstart* event is fired when a CSS transition has actually started, i.e., after any transition-delay has ended. This event is not cancelable.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *propertyName*: A string containing the name CSS property associated with the transition.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the transition has been running, in seconds, when this event fired. This value is not affected by the transition-delay property.<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| OnTransitionend      | Action<string, double, string> | The *transitionend* event is fired when a CSS transition has completed. In the case where a transition is removed before completion, such as if the transition-property is removed or display is set to none, then the event will not be generated. The *transitionend* event is fired in both directions - as it finishes transitioning to the transitioned state, and when it fully reverts to the default or non-transitioned state. If there is no transition delay or duration, if both are 0s or neither is declared, there is no transition, and none of the transition events are fired. If the transitioncancel event is fired, the transitionend event will not fire. This event is not cancelable.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *propertyName*: A string containing the name CSS property associated with the transition.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the transition has been running, in seconds, when this event fired. This value is not affected by the transition-delay property.<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string. |
| OnTransitionrun      | Action<string, double, string> | The *transitionrun* event is fired when a CSS transition is first created, i.e. before any transition-delay has begun. This event is not cancelable.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *propertyName*: A string containing the name CSS property associated with the transition.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the transition has been running, in seconds, when this event fired. This value is not affected by the transition-delay property.<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| OnTransitioncancel   | Action<string, double, string> | The *transitioncancel* event is fired when a CSS transition is canceled.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *propertyName*: A string containing the name CSS property associated with the transition.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the transition has been running, in seconds, when this event fired. This value is not affected by the transition-delay property.<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| OnAnimationstart     | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationstart* event is fired when a CSS Animation has started. If there is an animation-delay, this event will fire once the delay period has expired. A negative delay will cause the event to fire with an elapsedTime equal to the absolute value of the delay (and, correspondingly, the animation will begin playing at that time index into the sequence).<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                        |
| OnAnimationend       | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationend* event is fired when a CSS Animation has completed. If the animation aborts before reaching completion, such as if the element is removed from the DOM or the animation is removed from the element, the animationend event is not fired.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| OnAnimationiteration | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationiteration* event is fired when an iteration of a CSS Animation ends, and another one begins. This event does not occur at the same time as the animationend event, and therefore does not occur for animations with an animation-iteration-count of one.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| OnAnimationcancel    | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationcancel* event is fired when a CSS Animation unexpectedly aborts. In other words, any time it stops running without sending an animationend event. This might happen when the animation-name is changed such that the animation is removed, or when the animating node is hidden using CSS. Therefore, either directly or because any of its containing nodes are hidden. An event handler for this event can be added by setting the onanimationcancel property, or using addEventListener().<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                    |

| InnerText         | string                           | get/set | The *innerText* property of the HTMLElement interface represents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants.<br></br>As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard. As a setter this will replace the element's children with the given value, converting any line breaks into &lt;br&gt; elements.<br></br>Note: innerText is easily confused with Node.textContent, but there are important differences between the two. Basically, innerText is aware of the rendered appearance of text, while textContent is not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| OuterText         | string                           | get/set | The *outerText* property of the HTMLElement interface returns the same value as HTMLElement.innerText. When used as a setter it replaces the whole current node with the given text (this differs from innerText, which replaces the content inside the current node).<br></br>See InnerText for more information and examples showing how both properties are used as getters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| OffsetWidth       | int                              | get     | The *HTMLElement.offsetWidth* read-only property returns the layout width of an element as an integer.<br></br>Typically, offsetWidth is a measurement in pixels of the element's CSS width, including any borders, padding, and vertical scrollbars (if rendered). It does not include the width of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after.<br></br>If the element is hidden (for example, by setting style.display on the element or one of its ancestors to "none"), then 0 is returned.<br></br>Note: This property will round the value to an integer. If you need a fractional value, use element.getBoundingClientRect().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It does not include the height of pseudo-elements such as ::before or ::after. For the document body object, the measurement includes total linear content height instead of the element's CSS height.Floated elements extending below other linear content are ignored.<br></br>If the element is hidden(for example, by setting style.display on the element or one of its ancestors to "none"), then 0 is returned.<br></br>Note: This property will round the value to an integer. If you need a fractional value, use element.getBoundingClientRect().                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| OffsetLeft        | int                              | get     | The *HTMLElement.offsetLeft* read-only property returns the number of pixels that the upper left corner of the current element is offset to the left within the HTMLElement.offsetParent node.<br></br>For block-level elements, offsetTop, offsetLeft, offsetWidth, and offsetHeight describe the border box of an element relative to the offsetParent.<br></br>However, for inline-level elements (such as span) that can wrap from one line to the next, offsetTop and offsetLeft describe the positions of the first border box (use Element.getClientRects() to get its width and height), while offsetWidth and offsetHeight describe the dimensions of the bounding border box(use Element.getBoundingClientRect() to get its position). Therefore, a box with the left, top, width and height of offsetLeft, offsetTop, offsetWidth and offsetHeight will not be a bounding box for a span with wrapped text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, and height properties describe the position and size of the overall rectangle in pixels. Properties other than width and height are relative to the top-left of the viewport.<br></br>The width and height properties of the DOMRect object returned by the method include the padding and border-width, not only the content width/height. In the standard box model, this would be equal to the width or height property of the element + padding + border-width. But if box-sizing: border-box is set for the element this would be directly equal to its width or height.<br></br>The returned value can be thought of as the union of the rectangles returned by getClientRects() for the element, i.e., the CSS border-boxes associated with the element.<br></br>Empty border-boxes are completely ignored. If all the element's border-boxes are empty, then a rectangle is returned with a width and height of zero and where the top and left are the top-left of the border-box for the first CSS box (in content order) for the element.<br></br>The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area (or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the bounding rectangle. This means that the rectangle's boundary edges (top, right, bottom, left) change their values every time the scrolling position changes (because their values are relative to the viewport and not absolute).<br></br>If you need the bounding rectangle relative to the top-left corner of the document, just add the current scrolling position to the top and left properties (these can be obtained using window.scrollY and window.scrollX) to get a bounding rectangle which is independent from the current scrolling position. |

Each DOMRect object describes the border box, in pixels, with the top-left relative to the top-left of the viewport. For tables with captions, the caption is included even though it's outside the border box of the table. When called on SVG elements other than an outer-&lt;svg&gt;, the "viewport" that the resulting rectangles are relative to is the viewport that the element's outer-&lt;svg&gt; establishes (and to be clear, the rectangles are also transformed by the outer-&lt;svg&gt;'s viewBox transform, if any).<br></br>The amount of scrolling that has been done of the viewport area(or any other scrollable element) is taken into account when computing the rectangles.<br></br>The returned rectangles do not include the bounds of any child elements that might happen to overflow.<br></br>For HTML&lt;area&gt; elements, SVG elements that do not render anything themselves, display:none elements, and generally any elements that are not directly rendered, an empty list is returned.<br></br>Rectangles are returned even for CSS boxes that have empty border-boxes.The left, top, right, and bottom coordinates can still be meaningful.<br></br>Fractional pixel offsets are possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Subsequent events for the pointer will be targeted at the capture element until capture is released (via Element.releasePointerCapture() or the pointerup event is fired).<br></br>Note: Pointer capture will cause the target to capture all subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing target. Accordingly, pointerover, pointerenter, pointerleave, and pointerout will not fire as long as this capture is set. For touchscreen browsers that allow direct manipulation, an implicit pointer capture will be called on the element when a pointerdown event triggers. The capture can be released manually by calling element.releasePointerCapture on the target element, or it will be implicitly released after a pointerup or pointercancel event.<br></br>Pointer capture allows events for a particular pointer event (PointerEvent) to be re-targeted to a particular element instead of the normal(or hit test) target at a pointer's location. This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer events even if the pointer device's contact moves off the element(such as by scrolling or panning).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| OnAnimationiteration | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationiteration* event is fired when an iteration of a CSS Animation ends, and another one begins. This event does not occur at the same time as the animationend event, and therefore does not occur for animations with an animation-iteration-count of one.<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| OnAnimationcancel    | Action<string, double, string> | The *animationcancel* event is fired when a CSS Animation unexpectedly aborts. In other words, any time it stops running without sending an animationend event. This might happen when the animation-name is changed such that the animation is removed, or when the animating node is hidden using CSS. Therefore, either directly or because any of its containing nodes are hidden. An event handler for this event can be added by setting the onanimationcancel property, or using addEventListener().<br></br>**Parameters**<br></br>- string *animationName*: A string containing the value of the animation-name that generated the animation.<br></br>- double *elapsedTime*: A float giving the amount of time the animation has been running, in seconds, when this event fired, excluding any time the animation was paused. For an animationstart event, elapsedTime is 0.0 unless there was a negative value for animation-delay, in which case the event will be fired with elapsedTime containing (-1 * delay).<br></br>- string *pseudoElement*: A string, starting with '::', containing the name of the pseudo-element the animation runs on. If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                    |
