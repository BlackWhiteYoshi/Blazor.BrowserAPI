# Window

The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

A global variable, window, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user interface window.
However, the Window interface is a suitable place to include these items that need to be globally available.
Many of these are documented in the [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
and the [DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).

In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own Window object; the global window seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running.
That said, even in a tabbed browser, some properties and methods still apply to the overall window that contains the tab, such as *ResizeTo* and *InnerHeight*.
Generally, anything that can't reasonably pertain to a tab pertains to the window instead.

## Example

```csharp
public sealed class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase {
    [Inject]
    public required IWindow Window { private get; init; }

    private async Task Example() {
        int width = await Window.OuterWidth;
        int height = await Window.OuterHeight;
        await Window.Alert($"Size of the window is {width} x {height}");
    }
}
```

| InnerWidth          | ValueTask&lt;int&gt;           | get     | Returns the interior width of the window in pixels (that is, the width of the window's layout viewport). That includes the width of the vertical scroll bar, if one is present.<br/>Similarly, the interior height of the window (that is, the height of the layout viewport) can be obtained using the innerHeight property. That measurement also accounts for the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if it is visible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The width can be obtained using the *InnerWidth* property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| OuterWidth          | ValueTask&lt;int&gt;           | get     | Returns the width of the outside of the browser window. It represents the width of the whole browser window including sidebar (if expanded), window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| OuterHeight         | ValueTask&lt;int&gt;           | get     | Returns the height in pixels of the whole browser window, including any sidebar, window chrome, and window-resizing borders/handles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| DevicePixelRatio    | ValueTask&lt;double&gt;        | get     | Returns the ratio of the resolution in physical pixels to the resolution in CSS pixels for the current display device.<br/>This value could also be interpreted as the ratio of pixel sizes: the size of one CSS pixel to the size of one physical pixel. In simpler terms, this tells the browser how many of the screen's actual pixels should be used to draw a single CSS pixel.<br/>Page zooming affects the value of devicePixelRatio. When a page is zoomed in (made larger), the size of a CSS pixel increases, and so the devicePixelRatio value increases. Pinch-zooming does not affect devicePixelRatio, because this magnifies the page without changing the size of a CSS pixel.<br/>This is useful when dealing with the difference between rendering on a standard display versus a HiDPI or Retina display, which use more screen pixels to draw the same objects, resulting in a sharper image.<br/>You can use *MatchMedia()* to check if the value of devicePixelRatio changes (which can happen, for example, if the user drags the window to a display with a different pixel density). See [the example below](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio#monitoring_screen_resolution_or_zoom_level_changes). |
| ScrollX             | ValueTask&lt;double&gt;        | get     | Returns the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled horizontally. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled vertically from the *ScrollY* property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ScrollY             | ValueTask&lt;double&gt;        | get     | Returns the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled vertically. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number.

The relationship between a cross-origin opener of the document or any cross-origin popups that it opens are severed. The document may also be hosted in a separate OS process alongside other documents with which it can communicate by operating on shared memory.

Libraries can use this feature to catch errors in callback code and re-throw them to the top level handler. This ensures that an exception in one callback will not prevent others from being handled, while at the same time ensuring that stack trace information is still readily available for debugging at the top level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

You can learn more about how to use microtasks and why you might choose to do so in our [microtask guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide).<br/>The importance of microtasks comes in its ability to perform tasks asynchronously but in a specific order. See [Using microtasks in JavaScript with queueMicrotask()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide) for more details.<br/>Microtasks are especially useful for libraries and frameworks that need to perform final cleanup or other just-before-rendering tasks. |

This can occur through methods such as *Open* for popups or [iframe.contentWindow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow) for iframes.<br/>Broadly, one window may obtain a reference to another (e.g., via targetWindow = window.opener), and then dispatch a MessageEvent on it with targetWindow.postMessage(). The receiving window is then free to handle this event as needed. The arguments passed to window.postMessage() (i.e., the "message") are exposed to the receiving window through the *event object*.                                       |

If a promise was rejected (including an uncaught throw within an async function) and no rejection handlers were attached, an unhandledrejection event is fired instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| OnResize              | Action                                    | Fires when the document view (window) has been resized.<br/>This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br/>In some earlier browsers it was possible to register resize event handlers on any HTML element. It is still possible to set onresize attributes or use addEventListener() to set a handler on any element. However, resize events are only fired on the window object (i.e., returned by document.defaultView). Only handlers registered on the window object will receive resize events.<br/>While the resize event fires only for the window nowadays, you can get resize notifications for other elements using the ResizeObserver API.<br/>If the resize event is triggered too many times for your application, see [Optimizing window.onresize](https://bencentra.com/code/2015/02/27/optimizing-window-resize.html) to control the time after which the event fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| OnStorage             | Action&lt;StorageEvent&gt;                | Fires when another document that shares the same storage area (either localStorage or sessionStorage) as the current window updates that storage area. The event is not fired on the window that made the change.<br />- For localStorage, the event is fired in all other browsing contexts that are in the same origin as the initiating document. This includes other tabs with the same origin.<br />- For sessionStorage, the event is fired in all other browsing contexts that are in the same origin and the same top-level browsing context as the initiating document.

| OnBeforeUnload        | Action                                    | Is fired when the current window, contained document, and associated resources are about to be unloaded. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable at this point.<br/>The main use case for this event is to trigger a browser-generated confirmation dialog that asks users to confirm if they really want to leave the page when they try to close or reload it, or navigate somewhere else. This is intended to help prevent loss of unsaved data.<br/>The dialog can be triggered in the following ways:<br />- Calling the event object's preventDefault() method.<br />- Setting the event object's returnValue property to a non-empty string value or any other truthy value.<br />- Returning any truthy value from the event handler function, e.g., return "string".<br />Note that this only works when the function is attached via the onbeforeunload property, not the addEventListener() method. This behavior is consistent across modern versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.<br />The last two mechanisms are legacy features; best practice is to trigger the dialog by invoking preventDefault() on the event object, while also setting returnValue to support legacy cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| OnBeforeInstallPrompt | Action                                    | Fires when the browser has detected that a website can be installed as a Progressive Web App.<br/>There's no guaranteed time this event is fired, but it usually happens on page load.<br/>The typical use for this event is when a web app wants to provide its own in-app UI inviting the user to install the app, rather than the generic one provided by the browser. This enables the app to provide more context about the app, explaining to the user why they might want to install it.<br/>In this scenario, the handler for this event will:<br />- Keep a reference to the BeforeInstallPromptEvent object that's passed into it<br />- Reveal its in-app installation UI (this should be hidden by default, because not all browsers will support installation).<br/>When the user uses the in-app installation UI to install the app, the in-app installation UI calls the prompt() method of the retained BeforeInstallPromptEvent object to show the installation prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnScrollEnd           | Action                                    | Fires when element scrolling has completed. Scrolling is considered completed when the scroll position has no more pending updates and the user has completed their gesture.<br/>Scroll position updates include smooth or instant mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard scrolling, scroll-snap events, or other APIs and gestures which cause the scroll position to update. User gestures like touch panning or trackpad scrolling aren't complete until pointers or keys have released. If the scroll position did not change, then no scrollend event fires.<br/>For detecting when scrolling inside a Document is complete, see *the scrollend event of Document*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| OnChange              | Action                                    | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired for &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt; elements when the user modifies the element's value. Unlike the input event, the change event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's value.<br></br>Depending on the kind of element being changed and the way the user interacts with the element, the change event fires at a different moment:<br />- When a &lt;input type="checkbox"&gt; element is checked or unchecked (by clicking or using the keyboard);<br />- When a &lt;input type="radio"&gt; element is checked (but not when unchecked);<br />- When the user commits the change explicitly (e.g., by selecting a value from a &lt;select&gt;'s dropdown with a mouse click, by selecting a date from a date picker for &lt;input type="date"&gt;, by selecting a file in the file picker for &lt;input type="file"&gt;, etc.);<br />- When the element loses focus after its value was changed: for elements where the user's interaction is typing rather than selection, such as a &lt;textarea&gt; or the text, search, url, tel, email, or password types of the &lt;input&gt; element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| OnLoad                | Action                                    | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires for elements containing a resource when the resource has successfully loaded. Currently, the list of supported HTML elements are: &lt;body&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, and &lt;track&gt;.<br/>This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br></br>Note: The load event on HTMLBodyElement is actually an alias for the window.onload event. Therefore, the load event will only fire on the &lt;body&gt; element once all of the document's resources have loaded or errored. However, for the sake of clarity, it is recommended that the event handler is attached to the window object directly rather than on HTMLBodyElement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| OnInput               | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;      | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, or &lt;textarea&gt; element has been changed as a direct result of a user action (such as typing in a textbox or checking a checkbox).<br/>The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.<br/>For &lt;input&gt; elements with type=checkbox or type=radio, the input event should fire whenever a user toggles the control, per the HTML Living Standard specification. However, historically this has not always been the case. Check compatibility, or use the change event instead for elements of these types.<br/>For &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements that accept text input (type=text, type=tel, etc.), the interface is InputEvent; for others, the interface is Event.<br/>The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key or selecting a value from a list of options. Note that the input event is not fired when JavaScript changes an element's value programmatically.<br></br>**Parameters**<br/>- string? *data*: Holds the inserted characters. This may be an empty string if the change doesn't insert text (for example, when deleting characters).<br/>- string? *inputType*: The type of change for editable content such as, for example, inserting, deleting, or formatting text.<br/>- bool *isComposing*: Indicates if the event is fired after compositionstart and before compositionend. |
| OnBeforeInput         | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;      | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; element is about to be modified. But in contrast to the input event, it does not fire on the &lt;select&gt; element. The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on.<br/>This allows web apps to override text edit behavior before the browser modifies the DOM tree, and provides more control over input events to improve performance.<br/>In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host.

When using a physical mouse, mouseup events fire whenever any button on a mouse is released. pointerup events fire only upon the last button release; previous button releases, while other buttons are held down, don't fire pointerup events.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| OnWheel               | Action&lt;WheelEvent&gt;                  | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the user rotates a wheel button on a pointing device (typically a mouse). It is also fired for related devices that simulate wheel actions, such as trackpads and mouse balls.<br/>This event replaces the non-standard deprecated mousewheel event.<br/>Don't confuse the wheel event with the scroll event:<br />- A wheel event doesn't necessarily dispatch a scroll event. For example, the element may be unscrollable at all. Zooming actions using the wheel or trackpad also fire wheel events (with ctrlKey set to true).<br />- A scroll event isn't necessarily triggered by a wheel event. Elements can also be scrolled by using the keyboard, dragging a scrollbar, or using JavaScript.<br />- Even when the wheel event does trigger scrolling, the delta* values in the wheel event don't necessarily reflect the content's scrolling direction.<br />Therefore, do not rely on the wheel event's delta* properties to get the scrolling direction. Instead, detect value changes of scrollLeft and scrollTop of the target in the scroll event.<br/>The parameter represents the [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent") interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| OnMouseLeave          | Action&lt;MouseEvent&gt;                  | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.<br/>mouseleave and mouseout are similar but differ in that mouseleave does not bubble and mouseout does. This means that mouseleave is fired when the pointer has exited the element and all of its descendants, whereas mouseout is fired when the pointer leaves the element or leaves one of the element's descendants, because of bubbling (even if the pointer is still within the element). Other than that, leave and out events for the same situation are dispatched at the same time, if appropriate.<br/>The mouseleave and mouseout events will not be triggered when the element is replaced or removed from the DOM.<br/>Note that "moving out of an element" refers to the element's position in the DOM tree, not to its visual position. For example, if two sibling elements are positioned so one is placed inside the other, then moving from the outer element into the inner element will trigger mouseleave on the outer element, even though the pointer is still in the bounds of the outer element.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnPointerRawUpdate    | Action&lt;PointerEvent&gt;                | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire pointerdown or pointerup events. See pointermove for a list of these properties.<br/>The pointerrawupdate event may have coalesced events if there is already another pointerrawupdate event with the same pointer ID that hasn't been dispatched in the event loop. For information on coalesced events, see the [PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/getCoalescedEvents) documentation.<br/>pointerrawupdate is intended for applications that require high-precision input handling and cannot achieve smooth interaction using coalesced pointermove events alone. However, because listening to pointerrawupdate events can affect performance, you should add these listeners only if your JavaScript needs high-frequency events and can handle them as quickly as they are dispatched. For most use cases, other pointer event types should suffice.<br/>This event bubbles and is composed, but is not cancelable and has no default action.<br/>The parameter represents the [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note however that blur is not fired when a focused element is removed from the document.<br/>The opposite of blur is the focus event, which fires when the element has received focus.<br/>The blur event is not cancelable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The event frequency is dependent on the system load, but will be thrown between about 4Hz and 66Hz (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.

| InnerWidth          | int                    | get     | Returns the interior width of the window in pixels (that is, the width of the window's layout viewport). That includes the width of the vertical scroll bar, if one is present.<br/>Similarly, the interior height of the window (that is, the height of the layout viewport) can be obtained using the innerHeight property. That measurement also accounts for the height of the horizontal scroll bar, if it is visible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| DevicePixelRatio    | double                 | get     | Returns the ratio of the resolution in physical pixels to the resolution in CSS pixels for the current display device.<br/>This value could also be interpreted as the ratio of pixel sizes: the size of one CSS pixel to the size of one physical pixel. In simpler terms, this tells the browser how many of the screen's actual pixels should be used to draw a single CSS pixel.<br/>Page zooming affects the value of devicePixelRatio. When a page is zoomed in (made larger), the size of a CSS pixel increases, and so the devicePixelRatio value increases. Pinch-zooming does not affect devicePixelRatio, because this magnifies the page without changing the size of a CSS pixel.<br/>This is useful when dealing with the difference between rendering on a standard display versus a HiDPI or Retina display, which use more screen pixels to draw the same objects, resulting in a sharper image.<br/>You can use *MatchMedia()* to check if the value of devicePixelRatio changes (which can happen, for example, if the user drags the window to a display with a different pixel density). See [the example below](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio#monitoring_screen_resolution_or_zoom_level_changes). |
| ScrollX             | double                 | get     | Returns the number of pixels by which the document is currently scrolled horizontally. This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it isn't necessarily a whole number. You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled vertically from the *ScrollY* property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Name                | string                 | get/set | Gets/Sets the name of the window's browsing context.<br/>The name of the window is used primarily for setting targets for hyperlinks and forms. Browsing contexts do not need to have names.<br/>Modern browsers will reset Window.name to an empty string if a tab loads a page from a different domain, and restore the name if the original page is reloaded (e.g., by selecting the "back" button). This prevents an untrusted page from accessing any information that the previous page might have stored in the property (potentially the new page might also modify such data, which might then be read by the original page if it was reloaded).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The relationship between a cross-origin opener of the document or any cross-origin popups that it opens are severed.

It requests the browser to call a user-supplied callback function before the next repaint.<br/>The frequency of calls to the callback function will generally match the display refresh rate. The most common refresh rate is 60hz, (60 cycles/frames per second), though 75hz, 120hz, and 144hz are also widely used. requestAnimationFrame() calls are paused in most browsers when running in background tabs or hidden &lt;iframe&gt;s, in order to improve performance and battery life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| RequestIdleCallback      | Action handler, [int? timeout = null]                                    | IdleCallbackHandle   | Queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods. This enables developers to perform background and low priority work on the main thread, without impacting latency-critical events such as animation and input response. Functions are generally called in first-in-first-out order; however, callbacks which have a timeout specified may be called out-of-order if necessary in order to run them before the timeout elapses.<br/>You can call *RequestIdleCallback* within an idle callback function to schedule another callback to take place no sooner than the next pass through the event loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

You can learn more about how to use microtasks and why you might choose to do so in our [microtask guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide).<br/>The importance of microtasks comes in its ability to perform tasks asynchronously but in a specific order. See [Using microtasks in JavaScript with queueMicrotask()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API/Microtask_guide) for more details.<br/>Microtasks are especially useful for libraries and frameworks that need to perform final cleanup or other just-before-rendering tasks. |

This can occur through methods such as *Open* for popups or [iframe.contentWindow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow) for iframes.<br/>Broadly, one window may obtain a reference to another (e.g., via targetWindow = window.opener), and then dispatch a MessageEvent on it with targetWindow.postMessage(). The receiving window is then free to handle this event as needed. The arguments passed to window.postMessage() (i.e., the "message") are exposed to the receiving window through the *event object*.                                       |

If a promise was rejected (including an uncaught throw within an async function) and no rejection handlers were attached, an unhandledrejection event is fired instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| OnResize              | Action                                    | Fires when the document view (window) has been resized.<br/>This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br/>In some earlier browsers it was possible to register resize event handlers on any HTML element. It is still possible to set onresize attributes or use addEventListener() to set a handler on any element. However, resize events are only fired on the window object (i.e., returned by document.defaultView). Only handlers registered on the window object will receive resize events.<br/>While the resize event fires only for the window nowadays, you can get resize notifications for other elements using the ResizeObserver API.<br/>If the resize event is triggered too many times for your application, see [Optimizing window.onresize](https://bencentra.com/code/2015/02/27/optimizing-window-resize.html) to control the time after which the event fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| OnStorage             | Action&lt;StorageEvent&gt;                | Fires when another document that shares the same storage area (either localStorage or sessionStorage) as the current window updates that storage area. The event is not fired on the window that made the change.<br />- For localStorage, the event is fired in all other browsing contexts that are in the same origin as the initiating document. This includes other tabs with the same origin.<br />- For sessionStorage, the event is fired in all other browsing contexts that are in the same origin and the same top-level browsing context as the initiating document.

| OnBeforeUnload        | Action                                    | Is fired when the current window, contained document, and associated resources are about to be unloaded. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable at this point.<br/>The main use case for this event is to trigger a browser-generated confirmation dialog that asks users to confirm if they really want to leave the page when they try to close or reload it, or navigate somewhere else. This is intended to help prevent loss of unsaved data.<br/>The dialog can be triggered in the following ways:<br />- Calling the event object's preventDefault() method.<br />- Setting the event object's returnValue property to a non-empty string value or any other truthy value.<br />- Returning any truthy value from the event handler function, e.g., return "string".<br />Note that this only works when the function is attached via the onbeforeunload property, not the addEventListener() method. This behavior is consistent across modern versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.<br />The last two mechanisms are legacy features; best practice is to trigger the dialog by invoking preventDefault() on the event object, while also setting returnValue to support legacy cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| OnBeforeInstallPrompt | Action                                    | Fires when the browser has detected that a website can be installed as a Progressive Web App.<br/>There's no guaranteed time this event is fired, but it usually happens on page load.<br/>The typical use for this event is when a web app wants to provide its own in-app UI inviting the user to install the app, rather than the generic one provided by the browser. This enables the app to provide more context about the app, explaining to the user why they might want to install it.<br/>In this scenario, the handler for this event will:<br />- Keep a reference to the BeforeInstallPromptEvent object that's passed into it<br />- Reveal its in-app installation UI (this should be hidden by default, because not all browsers will support installation).<br/>When the user uses the in-app installation UI to install the app, the in-app installation UI calls the prompt() method of the retained BeforeInstallPromptEvent object to show the installation prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnScrollEnd           | Action                                    | Fires when element scrolling has completed. Scrolling is considered completed when the scroll position has no more pending updates and the user has completed their gesture.<br/>Scroll position updates include smooth or instant mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard scrolling, scroll-snap events, or other APIs and gestures which cause the scroll position to update. User gestures like touch panning or trackpad scrolling aren't complete until pointers or keys have released. If the scroll position did not change, then no scrollend event fires.<br/>For detecting when scrolling inside a Document is complete, see *the scrollend event of Document*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| OnChange              | Action                                    | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired for &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt; elements when the user modifies the element's value. Unlike the input event, the change event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's value.<br></br>Depending on the kind of element being changed and the way the user interacts with the element, the change event fires at a different moment:<br />- When a &lt;input type="checkbox"&gt; element is checked or unchecked (by clicking or using the keyboard);<br />- When a &lt;input type="radio"&gt; element is checked (but not when unchecked);<br />- When the user commits the change explicitly (e.g., by selecting a value from a &lt;select&gt;'s dropdown with a mouse click, by selecting a date from a date picker for &lt;input type="date"&gt;, by selecting a file in the file picker for &lt;input type="file"&gt;, etc.);<br />- When the element loses focus after its value was changed: for elements where the user's interaction is typing rather than selection, such as a &lt;textarea&gt; or the text, search, url, tel, email, or password types of the &lt;input&gt; element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| OnLoad                | Action                                    | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires for elements containing a resource when the resource has successfully loaded. Currently, the list of supported HTML elements are: &lt;body&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, and &lt;track&gt;.<br/>This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br></br>Note: The load event on HTMLBodyElement is actually an alias for the window.onload event. Therefore, the load event will only fire on the &lt;body&gt; element once all of the document's resources have loaded or errored. However, for the sake of clarity, it is recommended that the event handler is attached to the window object directly rather than on HTMLBodyElement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| OnInput               | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;      | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, or &lt;textarea&gt; element has been changed as a direct result of a user action (such as typing in a textbox or checking a checkbox).<br/>The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.<br/>For &lt;input&gt; elements with type=checkbox or type=radio, the input event should fire whenever a user toggles the control, per the HTML Living Standard specification. However, historically this has not always been the case. Check compatibility, or use the change event instead for elements of these types.<br/>For &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements that accept text input (type=text, type=tel, etc.), the interface is InputEvent; for others, the interface is Event.<br/>The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key or selecting a value from a list of options. Note that the input event is not fired when JavaScript changes an element's value programmatically.<br></br>**Parameters**<br/>- string? *data*: Holds the inserted characters. This may be an empty string if the change doesn't insert text (for example, when deleting characters).<br/>- string? *inputType*: The type of change for editable content such as, for example, inserting, deleting, or formatting text.<br/>- bool *isComposing*: Indicates if the event is fired after compositionstart and before compositionend. |
| OnBeforeInput         | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;      | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; element is about to be modified. But in contrast to the input event, it does not fire on the &lt;select&gt; element. The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on.<br/>This allows web apps to override text edit behavior before the browser modifies the DOM tree, and provides more control over input events to improve performance.<br/>In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host.

When using a physical mouse, mouseup events fire whenever any button on a mouse is released. pointerup events fire only upon the last button release; previous button releases, while other buttons are held down, don't fire pointerup events.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| OnWheel               | Action&lt;WheelEvent&gt;                  | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the user rotates a wheel button on a pointing device (typically a mouse). It is also fired for related devices that simulate wheel actions, such as trackpads and mouse balls.<br/>This event replaces the non-standard deprecated mousewheel event.<br/>Don't confuse the wheel event with the scroll event:<br />- A wheel event doesn't necessarily dispatch a scroll event. For example, the element may be unscrollable at all. Zooming actions using the wheel or trackpad also fire wheel events (with ctrlKey set to true).<br />- A scroll event isn't necessarily triggered by a wheel event. Elements can also be scrolled by using the keyboard, dragging a scrollbar, or using JavaScript.<br />- Even when the wheel event does trigger scrolling, the delta* values in the wheel event don't necessarily reflect the content's scrolling direction.<br />Therefore, do not rely on the wheel event's delta* properties to get the scrolling direction. Instead, detect value changes of scrollLeft and scrollTop of the target in the scroll event.<br/>The parameter represents the [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent") interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| OnMouseLeave          | Action&lt;MouseEvent&gt;                  | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.<br/>mouseleave and mouseout are similar but differ in that mouseleave does not bubble and mouseout does. This means that mouseleave is fired when the pointer has exited the element and all of its descendants, whereas mouseout is fired when the pointer leaves the element or leaves one of the element's descendants, because of bubbling (even if the pointer is still within the element). Other than that, leave and out events for the same situation are dispatched at the same time, if appropriate.<br/>The mouseleave and mouseout events will not be triggered when the element is replaced or removed from the DOM.<br/>Note that "moving out of an element" refers to the element's position in the DOM tree, not to its visual position. For example, if two sibling elements are positioned so one is placed inside the other, then moving from the outer element into the inner element will trigger mouseleave on the outer element, even though the pointer is still in the bounds of the outer element.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnPointerRawUpdate    | Action&lt;PointerEvent&gt;                | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire pointerdown or pointerup events. See pointermove for a list of these properties.<br/>The pointerrawupdate event may have coalesced events if there is already another pointerrawupdate event with the same pointer ID that hasn't been dispatched in the event loop. For information on coalesced events, see the [PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/getCoalescedEvents) documentation.<br/>pointerrawupdate is intended for applications that require high-precision input handling and cannot achieve smooth interaction using coalesced pointermove events alone. However, because listening to pointerrawupdate events can affect performance, you should add these listeners only if your JavaScript needs high-frequency events and can handle them as quickly as they are dispatched. For most use cases, other pointer event types should suffice.<br/>This event bubbles and is composed, but is not cancelable and has no default action.<br/>The parameter represents the [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note however that blur is not fired when a focused element is removed from the document.<br/>The opposite of blur is the focus event, which fires when the element has received focus.<br/>The blur event is not cancelable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The event frequency is dependent on the system load, but will be thrown between about 4Hz and 66Hz (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.
