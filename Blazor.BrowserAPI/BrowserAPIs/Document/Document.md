# Document

The *Document* interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

The DOM tree includes elements such as &lt;body&gt; and &lt;table&gt;, among many others.
It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.

The Document interface describes the common properties and methods for any kind of document.
Depending on the document's type (e.g., HTML, XML, SVG, …), a larger API is available:
HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface,
whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.

## Example

```csharp
public sealed partial class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase {
    [Inject]
    public required IDocument Document { private get; init; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() {
        await using IHTMLElement labelElement = await Document.CreateElement("label");
        await labelElement.SetInnerText("appended to body");
        await Document.Body.AppendChild(labelElement);
    }
}
```

| ScrollingElement        | IHTMLElement                    | get     | Returns a reference to the Element that scrolls the document.

| ActiveElement           | ValueTask&lt;IHTMLElement?&gt;  | get     | Returns the Element within the DOM that is receiving keyboard events such as keydown and keyup. This is usually analogous to the focused element.<br/>Which elements are focusable varies depending on the platform and the browser's current configuration. For example, on Safari, following the behavior of macOS, elements that aren't text input elements are not focusable by default, unless the "Full Keyboard Access" setting is enabled in System Preferences.<br/>Typically a user can press the Tab key to move the focus around the page among focusable elements, and use keyboard gestures such as Space or Enter to simulate clicks on the focused element.                                                                                                                            |
| CurrentScript           | ValueTask&lt;IHTMLElement?&gt;  | get     | Returns the &lt;script&gt; element whose script is currently being processed and isn't a JavaScript module. (For modules use import.meta instead.)<br/>It's important to note that this will not reference the &lt;script&gt; element if the code in the script is being called as a callback or event handler; it will only reference the element while it's initially being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| VisibilityState         | ValueTask&lt;string&gt;         | get     | Returns the visibility of the document. It can be used to check whether the document is in the background or in a minimized window, or is otherwise not visible to the user.<br/>When the value of this property changes, the visibilitychange event is sent to the Document.<br/>The *Hidden* property provides an alternative way to determine whether the page is hidden.<br/>The value is a string with one of the following values:<br />- "visible": The page content may be at least partially visible. In practice this means that the page is the foreground tab of a non-minimized window.<br />- "hidden": The page content is not visible to the user. In practice this means that the document is either a background tab or part of a minimized window, or the OS screen lock is active. |
| BaseURI                 | ValueTask&lt;string&gt;         | get     | The absolute base URL of the document containing the node.<br/>The base URL is used to resolve relative URLs when the browser needs to obtain an absolute URL, for example when processing the HTML &lt;img&gt; element's src attribute or the xlink:href Deprecated or href attributes in SVG.<br/>Although this property is read-only, its value is determined by an algorithm each time the property is accessed, and may change if the conditions changed.<br></br>The base URL is determined as follows:<br />1. By default, the base URL is the location of the document (as determined by window.location).<br />2. If it is an HTML Document and there is a &lt;Base&gt; element in the document, the href value of the first Base element with such an attribute is used instead.             |

| ScrollingElement        | IHTMLElementInProcess   | get     | Returns a reference to the Element that scrolls the document. In standards mode, this is the root element of the document, *DocumentElement*.<br/>When in quirks mode, the scrollingElement attribute returns the HTML body element if it exists and is not potentially scrollable, otherwise it returns null. This may look surprising but is true according to both the specification and browsers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| ActiveElement           | IHTMLElementInProcess?  | get     | Returns the Element within the DOM that is receiving keyboard events such as keydown and keyup. This is usually analogous to the focused element.<br/>Which elements are focusable varies depending on the platform and the browser's current configuration. For example, on Safari, following the behavior of macOS, elements that aren't text input elements are not focusable by default, unless the "Full Keyboard Access" setting is enabled in System Preferences.<br/>Typically a user can press the Tab key to move the focus around the page among focusable elements, and use keyboard gestures such as Space or Enter to simulate clicks on the focused element.                                                                                                                            |
| CurrentScript           | IHTMLElementInProcess?  | get     | Returns the &lt;script&gt; element whose script is currently being processed and isn't a JavaScript module. (For modules use import.meta instead.)<br/>It's important to note that this will not reference the &lt;script&gt; element if the code in the script is being called as a callback or event handler; it will only reference the element while it's initially being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| VisibilityState         | string                  | get     | Returns the visibility of the document. It can be used to check whether the document is in the background or in a minimized window, or is otherwise not visible to the user.<br/>When the value of this property changes, the visibilitychange event is sent to the Document.<br/>The *Hidden* property provides an alternative way to determine whether the page is hidden.<br/>The value is a string with one of the following values:<br />- "visible": The page content may be at least partially visible. In practice this means that the page is the foreground tab of a non-minimized window.<br />- "hidden": The page content is not visible to the user. In practice this means that the document is either a background tab or part of a minimized window, or the OS screen lock is active. |
| BaseURI                 | string                  | get     | The absolute base URL of the document containing the node.<br/>The base URL is used to resolve relative URLs when the browser needs to obtain an absolute URL, for example when processing the HTML &lt;img&gt; element's src attribute or the xlink:href Deprecated or href attributes in SVG.<br/>Although this property is read-only, its value is determined by an algorithm each time the property is accessed, and may change if the conditions changed.<br></br>The base URL is determined as follows:<br />1. By default, the base URL is the location of the document (as determined by window.location).<br />2. If it is an HTML Document and there is a &lt;Base&gt; element in the document, the href value of the first Base element with such an attribute is used instead.             |
