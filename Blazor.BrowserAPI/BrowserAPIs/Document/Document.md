# Document

The *Document* interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

The DOM tree includes elements such as &lt;body&gt; and &lt;table&gt;, among many others.
It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.

The Document interface describes the common properties and methods for any kind of document.
Depending on the document's type (e.g., HTML, XML, SVG, …), a larger API is available:
HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface,
whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.

## Example

```csharp
public sealed partial class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase {
    [Inject]
    public required IDocument Document { private get; init; }

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() {
        await using IHTMLElement labelElement = Document.CreateElement("label");
        await labelElement.SetInnerText("appended to body");
        await Document.Body.AppendChild(labelElement);
    }
}
```

| ActiveElement           | ValueTask&lt;IHTMLElement?&gt;  | get     | Returns the Element within the DOM that is receiving keyboard events such as keydown and keyup. This is usually analogous to the focused element.<br/>Which elements are focusable varies depending on the platform and the browser's current configuration. For example, on Safari, following the behavior of macOS, elements that aren't text input elements are not focusable by default, unless the "Full Keyboard Access" setting is enabled in System Preferences.<br/>Typically a user can press the Tab key to move the focus around the page among focusable elements, and use keyboard gestures such as Space or Enter to simulate clicks on the focused element.                                                                                                                            |
| CurrentScript           | ValueTask&lt;IHTMLElement?&gt;  | get     | Returns the &lt;script&gt; element whose script is currently being processed and isn't a JavaScript module. (For modules use import.meta instead.)<br/>It's important to note that this will not reference the &lt;script&gt; element if the code in the script is being called as a callback or event handler; it will only reference the element while it's initially being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| VisibilityState         | ValueTask&lt;string&gt;         | get     | Returns the visibility of the document. It can be used to check whether the document is in the background or in a minimized window, or is otherwise not visible to the user.<br/>When the value of this property changes, the visibilitychange event is sent to the Document.<br/>The *Hidden* property provides an alternative way to determine whether the page is hidden.<br/>The value is a string with one of the following values:<br />- "visible": The page content may be at least partially visible. In practice this means that the page is the foreground tab of a non-minimized window.<br />- "hidden": The page content is not visible to the user. In practice this means that the document is either a background tab or part of a minimized window, or the OS screen lock is active. |
| BaseURI                 | ValueTask&lt;string&gt;         | get     | The absolute base URL of the document containing the node.<br/>The base URL is used to resolve relative URLs when the browser needs to obtain an absolute URL, for example when processing the HTML &lt;img&gt; element's src attribute or the xlink:href Deprecated or href attributes in SVG.<br/>Although this property is read-only, its value is determined by an algorithm each time the property is accessed, and may change if the conditions changed.<br></br>The base URL is determined as follows:<br />1. By default, the base URL is the location of the document (as determined by window.location).<br />2.

| OnDOMContentLoaded        | Action                                     | Fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts (&lt;script defer src="…"&gt; and &lt;script type="module"&gt;) have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.<br/>DOMContentLoaded does not wait for stylesheets to load, however deferred scripts do wait for stylesheets, and the DOMContentLoaded event is queued after deferred scripts. Also, scripts which aren't deferred or async (e.g., &lt;script&gt;) will wait for already-parsed stylesheets to load.<br/>A different event, load, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page.

Scrolling is considered completed when the scroll position has no more pending updates and the user has completed their gesture.<br/>Scroll position updates include smooth or instant mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard scrolling, scroll-snap events, or other APIs and gestures which cause the scroll position to update. User gestures like touch panning or trackpad scrolling aren't complete until pointers or keys have released. If the scroll position did not change, then no scrollend event fires.<br/>For detecting when scrolling inside an element is complete, see the [IHTMLElement.OnScrollEnd](../HTMLElement/HTMLElement.md#events) event of Element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| OnInput                   | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;       | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, or &lt;textarea&gt; element has been changed as a direct result of a user action (such as typing in a textbox or checking a checkbox).<br/>The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.<br/>For &lt;input&gt; elements with type=checkbox or type=radio, the input event should fire whenever a user toggles the control, per the HTML Living Standard specification. However, historically this has not always been the case. Check compatibility, or use the change event instead for elements of these types.<br/>For &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements that accept text input (type=text, type=tel, etc.), the interface is InputEvent; for others, the interface is Event.<br/>The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key or selecting a value from a list of options. Note that the input event is not fired when JavaScript changes an element's value programmatically.<br></br>**Parameters**<br/>- string? *data*: Holds the inserted characters. This may be an empty string if the change doesn't insert text (for example, when deleting characters).<br/>- string? *inputType*: The type of change for editable content such as, for example, inserting, deleting, or formatting text.<br/>- bool *isComposing*: Indicates if the event is fired after compositionstart and before compositionend. |
| OnBeforeInput             | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;       | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; element is about to be modified. But in contrast to the input event, it does not fire on the &lt;select&gt; element. The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on.<br/>This allows web apps to override text edit behavior before the browser modifies the DOM tree, and provides more control over input events to improve performance.<br/>In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host.

| OnWheel                   | Action&lt;WheelEvent&gt;                   | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the user rotates a wheel button on a pointing device (typically a mouse). It is also fired for related devices that simulate wheel actions, such as trackpads and mouse balls.<br/>This event replaces the non-standard deprecated mousewheel event.<br/>Don't confuse the wheel event with the scroll event:<br />- A wheel event doesn't necessarily dispatch a scroll event. For example, the element may be unscrollable at all. Zooming actions using the wheel or trackpad also fire wheel events (with ctrlKey set to true).<br />- A scroll event isn't necessarily triggered by a wheel event. Elements can also be scrolled by using the keyboard, dragging a scrollbar, or using JavaScript.<br />- Even when the wheel event does trigger scrolling, the delta* values in the wheel event don't necessarily reflect the content's scrolling direction.<br />Therefore, do not rely on the wheel event's delta* properties to get the scrolling direction. Instead, detect value changes of scrollLeft and scrollTop of the target in the scroll event.<br/>The parameter represents the [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent") interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| OnMouseLeave              | Action&lt;MouseEvent&gt;                   | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.<br/>mouseleave and mouseout are similar but differ in that mouseleave does not bubble and mouseout does. This means that mouseleave is fired when the pointer has exited the element and all of its descendants, whereas mouseout is fired when the pointer leaves the element or leaves one of the element's descendants, because of bubbling (even if the pointer is still within the element). Other than that, leave and out events for the same situation are dispatched at the same time, if appropriate.<br/>The mouseleave and mouseout events will not be triggered when the element is replaced or removed from the DOM.<br/>Note that "moving out of an element" refers to the element's position in the DOM tree, not to its visual position. For example, if two sibling elements are positioned so one is placed inside the other, then moving from the outer element into the inner element will trigger mouseleave on the outer element, even though the pointer is still in the bounds of the outer element.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnPointerRawUpdate        | Action&lt;PointerEvent&gt;                 | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire pointerdown or pointerup events. See pointermove for a list of these properties.<br/>The pointerrawupdate event may have coalesced events if there is already another pointerrawupdate event with the same pointer ID that hasn't been dispatched in the event loop. For information on coalesced events, see the [PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/getCoalescedEvents) documentation.<br/>pointerrawupdate is intended for applications that require high-precision input handling and cannot achieve smooth interaction using coalesced pointermove events alone. However, because listening to pointerrawupdate events can affect performance, you should add these listeners only if your JavaScript needs high-frequency events and can handle them as quickly as they are dispatched. For most use cases, other pointer event types should suffice.<br/>This event bubbles and is composed, but is not cancelable and has no default action.<br/>The parameter represents the [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note however that blur is not fired when a focused element is removed from the document.<br/>The opposite of blur is the focus event, which fires when the element has received focus.<br/>The blur event is not cancelable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The event frequency is dependent on the system load, but will be thrown between about 4Hz and 66Hz (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.

For example, on Safari, following the behavior of macOS, elements that aren't text input elements are not focusable by default, unless the "Full Keyboard Access" setting is enabled in System Preferences.<br/>Typically a user can press the Tab key to move the focus around the page among focusable elements, and use keyboard gestures such as Space or Enter to simulate clicks on the focused element.                                                                                                                            |
| CurrentScript           | IHTMLElementInProcess?  | get     | Returns the &lt;script&gt; element whose script is currently being processed and isn't a JavaScript module. (For modules use import.meta instead.)<br/>It's important to note that this will not reference the &lt;script&gt; element if the code in the script is being called as a callback or event handler; it will only reference the element while it's initially being processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The state indicates that the DOMContentLoaded event is about to fire.<br />- "complete": The document and all sub-resources have finished loading. The state indicates that the load event is about to fire.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Referrer                | string                  | get     | Returns the URI of the page that linked to this page.<br/>The value is an empty string if the user navigated to the page directly (not through a link, but, for example, by using a bookmark). Because this property returns only a string, it doesn't give you document object model (DOM) access to the referring page.<br/>Inside an &lt;iframe&gt;, the Document.referrer will initially be set to the href of the parent's Window.location in same-origin requests. In cross-origin requests, it's the origin of the parent's Window.location by default.

| VisibilityState         | string                  | get     | Returns the visibility of the document. It can be used to check whether the document is in the background or in a minimized window, or is otherwise not visible to the user.<br/>When the value of this property changes, the visibilitychange event is sent to the Document.<br/>The *Hidden* property provides an alternative way to determine whether the page is hidden.<br/>The value is a string with one of the following values:<br />- "visible": The page content may be at least partially visible. In practice this means that the page is the foreground tab of a non-minimized window.<br />- "hidden": The page content is not visible to the user. In practice this means that the document is either a background tab or part of a minimized window, or the OS screen lock is active. |
| BaseURI                 | string                  | get     | The absolute base URL of the document containing the node.<br/>The base URL is used to resolve relative URLs when the browser needs to obtain an absolute URL, for example when processing the HTML &lt;img&gt; element's src attribute or the xlink:href Deprecated or href attributes in SVG.<br/>Although this property is read-only, its value is determined by an algorithm each time the property is accessed, and may change if the conditions changed.<br></br>The base URL is determined as follows:<br />1. By default, the base URL is the location of the document (as determined by window.location).<br />2. If it is an HTML Document and there is a &lt;Base&gt; element in the document, the href value of the first Base element with such an attribute is used instead.             |

| OnSecurityPolicyViolation | Action&lt;SecurityPolicyViolationEvent&gt; | Is fired when a Content Security Policy is violated.<br/>The event is fired on the element when there is a violation of the CSP policy (and may also bubble from elements in the document).<br/>This event bubbles to the Window object, and is composed.<br/>Note: You should generally add the handler for this event to a top level object (i.e., Window or Document). While HTML elements can technically be the target of the securitypolicyviolation event, in reality this event does not fire on them<br />for example, a blocked &lt;img&gt; source directly triggers this event on document as the target, instead of bubbling from the &lt;img&gt; element.<br/>The parameter represents the [SecurityPolicyViolationEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SecurityPolicyViolationEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| OnDOMContentLoaded        | Action                                     | Fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts (&lt;script defer src="…"&gt; and &lt;script type="module"&gt;) have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.<br/>DOMContentLoaded does not wait for stylesheets to load, however deferred scripts do wait for stylesheets, and the DOMContentLoaded event is queued after deferred scripts. Also, scripts which aren't deferred or async (e.g., &lt;script&gt;) will wait for already-parsed stylesheets to load.<br/>A different event, load, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page.

Scrolling is considered completed when the scroll position has no more pending updates and the user has completed their gesture.<br/>Scroll position updates include smooth or instant mouse wheel scrolling, keyboard scrolling, scroll-snap events, or other APIs and gestures which cause the scroll position to update. User gestures like touch panning or trackpad scrolling aren't complete until pointers or keys have released. If the scroll position did not change, then no scrollend event fires.<br/>For detecting when scrolling inside an element is complete, see the [IHTMLElement.OnScrollEnd](../HTMLElement/HTMLElement.md#events) event of Element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| OnInput                   | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;       | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, or &lt;textarea&gt; element has been changed as a direct result of a user action (such as typing in a textbox or checking a checkbox).<br/>The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on. In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host. If these properties apply to multiple elements, the editing host is the nearest ancestor element whose parent isn't editable.<br/>For &lt;input&gt; elements with type=checkbox or type=radio, the input event should fire whenever a user toggles the control, per the HTML Living Standard specification. However, historically this has not always been the case. Check compatibility, or use the change event instead for elements of these types.<br/>For &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;input&gt; elements that accept text input (type=text, type=tel, etc.), the interface is InputEvent; for others, the interface is Event.<br/>The input event is fired every time the value of the element changes. This is unlike the change event, which only fires when the value is committed, such as by pressing the enter key or selecting a value from a list of options. Note that the input event is not fired when JavaScript changes an element's value programmatically.<br></br>**Parameters**<br/>- string? *data*: Holds the inserted characters. This may be an empty string if the change doesn't insert text (for example, when deleting characters).<br/>- string? *inputType*: The type of change for editable content such as, for example, inserting, deleting, or formatting text.<br/>- bool *isComposing*: Indicates if the event is fired after compositionstart and before compositionend. |
| OnBeforeInput             | Action&lt;string?, string?, bool&gt;       | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the value of an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt; element is about to be modified. But in contrast to the input event, it does not fire on the &lt;select&gt; element. The event also applies to elements with contenteditable enabled, and to any element when designMode is turned on.<br/>This allows web apps to override text edit behavior before the browser modifies the DOM tree, and provides more control over input events to improve performance.<br/>In the case of contenteditable and designMode, the event target is the editing host.

| OnWheel                   | Action&lt;WheelEvent&gt;                   | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Fires when the user rotates a wheel button on a pointing device (typically a mouse). It is also fired for related devices that simulate wheel actions, such as trackpads and mouse balls.<br/>This event replaces the non-standard deprecated mousewheel event.<br/>Don't confuse the wheel event with the scroll event:<br />- A wheel event doesn't necessarily dispatch a scroll event. For example, the element may be unscrollable at all. Zooming actions using the wheel or trackpad also fire wheel events (with ctrlKey set to true).<br />- A scroll event isn't necessarily triggered by a wheel event. Elements can also be scrolled by using the keyboard, dragging a scrollbar, or using JavaScript.<br />- Even when the wheel event does trigger scrolling, the delta* values in the wheel event don't necessarily reflect the content's scrolling direction.<br />Therefore, do not rely on the wheel event's delta* properties to get the scrolling direction. Instead, detect value changes of scrollLeft and scrollTop of the target in the scroll event.<br/>The parameter represents the [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent") interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| OnMouseLeave              | Action&lt;MouseEvent&gt;                   | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.<br/>mouseleave and mouseout are similar but differ in that mouseleave does not bubble and mouseout does. This means that mouseleave is fired when the pointer has exited the element and all of its descendants, whereas mouseout is fired when the pointer leaves the element or leaves one of the element's descendants, because of bubbling (even if the pointer is still within the element). Other than that, leave and out events for the same situation are dispatched at the same time, if appropriate.<br/>The mouseleave and mouseout events will not be triggered when the element is replaced or removed from the DOM.<br/>Note that "moving out of an element" refers to the element's position in the DOM tree, not to its visual position. For example, if two sibling elements are positioned so one is placed inside the other, then moving from the outer element into the inner element will trigger mouseleave on the outer element, even though the pointer is still in the bounds of the outer element.<br/>The parameter represents the [MouseEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| OnPointerRawUpdate        | Action&lt;PointerEvent&gt;                 | Bubbled event invoked from child elements.<br></br>Is fired when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire pointerdown or pointerup events. See pointermove for a list of these properties.<br/>The pointerrawupdate event may have coalesced events if there is already another pointerrawupdate event with the same pointer ID that hasn't been dispatched in the event loop. For information on coalesced events, see the [PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/getCoalescedEvents) documentation.<br/>pointerrawupdate is intended for applications that require high-precision input handling and cannot achieve smooth interaction using coalesced pointermove events alone. However, because listening to pointerrawupdate events can affect performance, you should add these listeners only if your JavaScript needs high-frequency events and can handle them as quickly as they are dispatched. For most use cases, other pointer event types should suffice.<br/>This event bubbles and is composed, but is not cancelable and has no default action.<br/>The parameter represents the [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note however that blur is not fired when a focused element is removed from the document.<br/>The opposite of blur is the focus event, which fires when the element has received focus.<br/>The blur event is not cancelable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If the transition doesn't run on a pseudo-element but on the element, an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The event frequency is dependent on the system load, but will be thrown between about 4Hz and 66Hz (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost of processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.
