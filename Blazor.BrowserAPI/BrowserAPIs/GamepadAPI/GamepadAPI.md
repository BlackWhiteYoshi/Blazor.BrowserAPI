# Gamepad API

The *Gamepad API* is a way for developers to access and respond to signals from gamepads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
It contains three interfaces, two events and one specialist function, to respond to gamepads being connected and disconnected,
and to access other information about the gamepads themselves, and what buttons and other controls are currently being pressed.

## Example

```csharp
public sealed partial class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase, IAsyncDisposable {
    [Inject]
    public required IGamepadAPI GamepadAPI { private get; init; }

    private IGamepad? gamepad = null;


    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() {
        IGamepad[] gamepads = await GamepadAPI.GetGamepads();
        if (gamepads.Length > 0) {
            // this example only uses one gamepad
            gamepad = gamepads[0];
            // dispose all other gamepads, if any
            for (int i = 1; i < gamepads.Length; i++)
                await gamepads[i].DisposeAsync();
        }

        GamepadAPI.OnGamepadConnected += OnGamepadConnected;
        GamepadAPI.OnGamepadDisconnected += OnGamepadDisconnected;
    }

    public void OnGamepadConnected(IGamepad gamepad) {

    private async Task ReadGamepadInput() {
        if (gamepad is null)
            return;

        double[] axes = await gamepad.Axes;
        GamepadButton[] buttons = await gamepad.Buttons;

        Console.WriteLine($"axes: {string.Join(", ", axes)}");

### IGamepadAPI

The *Gamepad API* is a way for developers to access and respond to signals from gamepads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
It contains three interfaces, two events and one specialist function, to respond to gamepads being connected and disconnected,
and to access other information about the gamepads themselves, and what buttons and other controls are currently being pressed.

#### Methods

| **Name**    | **Parameters**                                  | **ReturnType**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GetGamepads | [CancellationToken cancellationToken = default] | ValueTask&lt;IGamepad?[]&gt; | Returns an array of [IGamepad](#igamepad) objects, one for each connected gamepad.<br/>Elements in the array may be *null* if a gamepad disconnects during a session, so that the remaining gamepads retain the same index.      |

#### Events

| **Name**              | **Type**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OnGamepadConnected    | Action&lt;IGamepad&gt; | The *gamepadconnected* event is fired when the browser detects that a gamepad has been connected or the first time a button/axis of the gamepad is used. The event will not fire if disallowed by the document's gamepad Permissions Policy. This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br />Parameter is the connected Gamepad. Note: Dispose the given Gamepad object when you are done with it. |
| OnGamepadDisconnected | Action&lt;IGamepad&gt; | The *gamepaddisconnected* event is fired when the browser detects that a gamepad has been disconnected. The event will not fire if disallowed by the document's gamepad Permissions Policy. This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br />Parameter is the disconnected Gamepad. Note: Dispose the given Gamepad object when you are done with it.                                               |

### IGamepadAPIInProcess

The *Gamepad API* is a way for developers to access and respond to signals from gamepads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.
It contains three interfaces, two events and one specialist function, to respond to gamepads being connected and disconnected,
and to access other information about the gamepads themselves, and what buttons and other controls are currently being pressed.

#### Methods

| **Name**    | **Parameters** | **ReturnType**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GetGamepads | *empty*        | IGamepadInProcess?[] | Returns an array of [IGamepadInProcess](#igamepadinprocess) objects, one for each connected gamepad.<br/>Elements in the array may be *null* if a gamepad disconnects during a session, so that the remaining gamepads retain the same index.      |

#### Events

| **Name**              | **Type**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OnGamepadConnected    | Action&lt;IGamepadInProcess&gt; | The *gamepadconnected* event is fired when the browser detects that a gamepad has been connected or the first time a button/axis of the gamepad is used. The event will not fire if disallowed by the document's gamepad Permissions Policy. This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br />Parameter is the connected Gamepad. Note: Dispose the given Gamepad object when you are done with it. |
| OnGamepadDisconnected | Action&lt;IGamepadInProcess&gt; | The *gamepaddisconnected* event is fired when the browser detects that a gamepad has been disconnected. The event will not fire if disallowed by the document's gamepad Permissions Policy. This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.<br />Parameter is the disconnected Gamepad. Note: Dispose the given Gamepad object when you are done with it.                                               |
