# Navigator

The Navigator interface represents the state and the identity of the user agent.
It allows scripts to query it and to register themselves to carry on some activities.

## Example

```csharp
public sealed class ExampleComponent : ComponentBase {
    [Inject]
    public required INavigator Navigator { private get; init; }

    private async Task Example() {
        string browserLanguage = await Navigator.Language;
    }
}

| Language                    | ValueTask&lt;string&gt; | get     | Represents the preferred language of the user, usually the language of the browser UI.<br/>The value represents the language version as defined in [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646). Examples of valid language codes include "en", "en-US", "fr", "fr-FR", "es-ES", etc.<br />Note that in Safari on iOS prior to 10.2, the country code returned is lowercase: "en-us", "fr-fr" etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Languages                   | ValueTask&lt;string&gt; | get     | Represents the user's preferred languages.<br/>The language is described using language tags according to [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646). In the returned array they are ordered by preference with the most preferred language first.<br/>The value of *Language* is the first element of the returned array.<br/>When its value changes, as the user's preferred languages are changed a [OnLanguageChange](../Window/Window.md#events) event is fired on the [IWindowInProcess](../Window/Window.md#iwindowinprocess) object.<br/>The Accept-Language HTTP header in every HTTP request from the user's browser generally lists the same locales as the navigator.languages property, with decreasing q values (quality values). Some browsers (Chrome and Safari) add language-only fallback tags in Accept-Language—for example, en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q=0.7 when navigator.languages is ["en-US", "zh-CN"]. For privacy purposes (reducing fingerprinting), both Accept-Language and navigator.languages may not include the full list of user preferences, such as in Safari (always) and Chrome's incognito mode, where only one language is listed. |
| UserAgent                   | ValueTask&lt;string&gt; | get     | Returns the user agent string for the current browser.<br/>Browser identification based on detecting the user agent string is unreliable and is not recommended, as the user agent string is user configurable. For example:<br />- In Firefox, you can change the preference general.useragent.override in about:config. Some Firefox extensions do that; however, this only changes the HTTP header that gets sent and that is returned by navigator.userAgent. There might be other methods that utilize JavaScript code to identify the browser.<br />- Opera 6+ allows users to set the browser identification string via a menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| HardwareConcurrency         | ValueTask&lt;int&gt;    | get     | Returns the number of logical processors available to run threads on the user's computer.<br/>The number is between 1 and the number of logical processors potentially available to the user agent.<br/>Modern computers have multiple physical processor cores in their CPU (two or four cores is typical), but each physical core is also usually able to run more than one thread at a time using advanced scheduling techniques. So a four-core CPU may offer eight logical processor cores, for example. The number of logical processor cores can be used to measure the number of threads which can effectively be run at once without them having to context switch.<br/>The browser may, however, choose to report a lower number of logical cores in order to represent more accurately the number of Workers that can run at once, so don't treat this as an absolute measurement of the number of cores in the user's system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Reasons the data might be invalid include:<br />- The data parameter has been omitted or only contains properties with unknown values. Note that any properties that are not recognized by the user agent are ignored.<br/>- A URL is badly formatted.<br />- Files are specified but the implementation does not support file sharing.<br />- Sharing the specified data would be considered a "hostile share" by the user-agent.<br/>The Web Share API is gated by the web-share permission policy. The canShare() method will return false if the permission is supported but has not been granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If the device doesn't support vibration, this method has no effect. If a vibration pattern is already in progress when this method is called, the previous pattern is halted and the new one begins instead.<br />Passing an empty array or an array containing all zeros will cancel any currently ongoing vibration pattern.<br/>If the method was unable to vibrate because of invalid parameters, it will return false, else it returns true. If the pattern leads to a too long vibration, it is truncated: the max length depends on the implementation.<br/>Some devices may not vibrate if they are in Silent mode or Do Not Disturb (DND) mode. To ensure vibration works, make sure these modes are turned off and that vibration is enabled in the system settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Language                    | string    | get     | Represents the preferred language of the user, usually the language of the browser UI.<br/>The value represents the language version as defined in [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646). Examples of valid language codes include "en", "en-US", "fr", "fr-FR", "es-ES", etc.<br />Note that in Safari on iOS prior to 10.2, the country code returned is lowercase: "en-us", "fr-fr" etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Languages                   | string    | get     | Represents the user's preferred languages.<br/>The language is described using language tags according to [RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646). In the returned array they are ordered by preference with the most preferred language first.<br/>The value of *Language* is the first element of the returned array.<br/>When its value changes, as the user's preferred languages are changed a [OnLanguageChange](../Window/Window.md#events) event is fired on the [IWindow](../Window/Window.md#iwindow) object.<br/>The Accept-Language HTTP header in every HTTP request from the user's browser generally lists the same locales as the navigator.languages property, with decreasing q values (quality values). Some browsers (Chrome and Safari) add language-only fallback tags in Accept-Language—for example, en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q=0.7 when navigator.languages is ["en-US", "zh-CN"]. For privacy purposes (reducing fingerprinting), both Accept-Language and navigator.languages may not include the full list of user preferences, such as in Safari (always) and Chrome's incognito mode, where only one language is listed. |
| UserAgent                   | string    | get     | Returns the user agent string for the current browser.<br/>Browser identification based on detecting the user agent string is unreliable and is not recommended, as the user agent string is user configurable. For example:<br />- In Firefox, you can change the preference general.useragent.override in about:config. Some Firefox extensions do that; however, this only changes the HTTP header that gets sent and that is returned by navigator.userAgent. There might be other methods that utilize JavaScript code to identify the browser.<br />- Opera 6+ allows users to set the browser identification string via a menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Webdriver                   | bool      | get     | Indicates whether the user agent is controlled by automation.<br/>It defines a standard way for co-operating user agents to inform the document that it is controlled by WebDriver, for example, so that alternate code paths can be triggered during automation.<br/>The navigator.webdriver property is true when in:<br />- Chrome: The --enable-automation or --headless flag is used, or the --remote-debugging-port flag specifying port 0 is used.<br />- Firefox: The marionette.enabled preference or --marionette flag is passed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| HardwareConcurrency         | int       | get     | Returns the number of logical processors available to run threads on the user's computer.<br/>The number is between 1 and the number of logical processors potentially available to the user agent.<br/>Modern computers have multiple physical processor cores in their CPU (two or four cores is typical), but each physical core is also usually able to run more than one thread at a time using advanced scheduling techniques. So a four-core CPU may offer eight logical processor cores, for example. The number of logical processor cores can be used to measure the number of threads which can effectively be run at once without them having to context switch.<br/>The browser may, however, choose to report a lower number of logical cores in order to represent more accurately the number of Workers that can run at once, so don't treat this as an absolute measurement of the number of cores in the user's system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

If the device doesn't support vibration, this method has no effect. If a vibration pattern is already in progress when this method is called, the previous pattern is halted and the new one begins instead.<br />Passing an empty array or an array containing all zeros will cancel any currently ongoing vibration pattern.<br/>If the method was unable to vibrate because of invalid parameters, it will return false, else it returns true. If the pattern leads to a too long vibration, it is truncated: the max length depends on the implementation.<br/>Some devices may not vibrate if they are in Silent mode or Do Not Disturb (DND) mode. To ensure vibration works, make sure these modes are turned off and that vibration is enabled in the system settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This could be used for content personalization such as removing "install our app" banners from the web app if the platform-specific app and/or PWA is already installed.<br/>It can be used to check for the installation of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, Android apps, and PWAs that are related to the web app calling this method.<br/>To associate the invoking web app with a platform-specific app or PWA, two things must be done:<br />1. The invoking web app must be specified in the [related_applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest/Reference/related_applications) member of its [manifest file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest).<br />2. The platform-specific app or PWA must have its relationship with the invoking app defined.<br/>Defining the relationship is done in a different way depending on the type of app:<br />- An Android app does this via the [Digital Asset Links system](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started).<br />- A Windows UWP app does this via [URI Handlers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/launch/web-to-app-linking).<br />- A PWA does this via:<br />--- A self-defining entry inside its own *related_applications* manifest member in the case of a PWA checking if it is installed on the underlying platform.<br />--- An assetlinks.json file in its [/.well-known/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785) directory in the case of an app outside the scope of the PWA checking whether it is installed. |
